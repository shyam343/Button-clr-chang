## Color-Changing Button & Time-Based Greeting
## Hosted Live:- [button-clr-change.netlify.app](https://button-clr-change.netlify.app/)
This project demonstrates the use of Html, CSS, JavaScript to create dynamic web elements. It features two main components:
+ A button that changes its background color when clicked.
- An alert box that displays a greeting message based on the current time (e.g., "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening").
## Features:
#  Color-Changing Button:
- A button that switches between two colors (e.g., red and blue) whenever the user clicks on it.
+ Time-Based Greeting:
+ When the user loads the page, an alert box is triggered to display a greeting message depending on the time of day:
+ Good Morning (if it's before noon)
- Good Afternoon (if it's between noon and 6 PM)
+ Good Evening (if it's after 6 PM)
How It Works:
Button: The button listens for a click event. When clicked, JavaScript logic dynamically toggles between two predefined background colors.

Greeting Alert: JavaScript retrieves the current hour of the day and uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate greeting message. The message is displayed via an alert box when the page is loaded.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used to create the button structure.
CSS: Simple styling for the button.
JavaScript: Used to implement the button's color-changing functionality and the time-based greeting.
